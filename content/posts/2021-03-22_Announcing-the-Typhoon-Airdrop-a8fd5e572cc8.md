With only 4 days left until our [IFO with GooseFinance](https://typhoonnetwork.medium.com/announcing-our-ifo-with-goose-defi-51021aa8be64), we’re working very hard on getting the service as polished as we can. We truly believe we have built something great and want everyone with a BSC wallet to give it a try and give us feedback!

Further to this, if you try Typhoon before the IFO and deposit into any of the available vaults, you’ll automatically qualify for our TYPH airdrop!

#### How to qualify for the Airdrop?

It’s actually pretty easy, you’ll have to do 2 things:

1.  Use any of the [Typhoon mainnet vaults](https://app.typhoon.network/) and deposit some funds before IFO date
2.  Join [our Telegram](https://t.me/typhoonnetwork) group

That’s all. You are now eligible for the airdrop.

#### Participation details

- 100,000 TYPH tokens (~$50,000 USD) are allocated for this Airdrop
- Only wallets that _deposit_ funds are eligible, just withdrawing isn’t enough
- Each wallet can qualify for each vault once. So the same wallet can for example qualify for both, the 1BNB and the 0.1BNB vault at the same time
- Token amount will be calculated proportional to used vault size
- The snapshot will be taken on the same block that the IFO starts on. All deposits afterwards will not qualify. (Block: [https://bscscan.com/block/countdown/6025000](https://bscscan.com/block/countdown/6025000))
- The actual airdrop date will be a couple weeks after the IFO, no exact date is given

#### How the Airdrop will get distributed

Once released to mainnet, qualifying addresses will be able to claim their airdropped TYPH through the main app at [http://app.typhoon.network.](http://app.typhoon.network.)

This step is important as we won’t automatically send the tokens to your wallet. There is however no time-limit set on when you have to claim your tokens.

Make sure to follow us on Twitter and Telegram to be the first to know when the tokens are claimable!

#### Tell us what you think!

We need your feedback to make Typhoon better. Tell us on Telegram or Twitter what you thought about it, and we’ll make sure to include it when considering what to implement next.
